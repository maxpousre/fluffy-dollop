DESCRIPTION: Tire and Wheel Components

==========================================
WEB SEARCH CONFIGURATION
==========================================
WEB_SEARCH_REQUIRED: True
WEB_SEARCH_CATEGORIES:
  - Tires with unclear tread pattern
  - Tires without position specification
  - Custom or specialty tires

WEB_SEARCH_QUERY_TEMPLATE: "{Part Name} {Part Code} - Rib or Lug Pattern for rib vs. number of plys"

==========================================
PATTERN MATCHING RULES
==========================================

1. TIRE SIZE DETECTION:
   Standard Formats:
   - Metric: "11R22.5", "295/75R22.5"
   - Standard: "10.00R20", "9.00-20"

   Extract:
   - Width (e.g., 11, 295, 10.00)
   - Aspect ratio if present (e.g., 75)
   - Rim diameter (e.g., 22.5, 20)

2. PLY RATING DETECTION:
   Keywords: "ply", "PR", "load range"

   Common Ratings:
   - Light duty: 6, 8, 10 ply
   - Heavy duty: 12, 14, 16, 18 ply

3. TREAD PATTERN DETECTION:
   Rib Pattern: "rib", "highway", "R", "steer"
   Lug Pattern: "lug", "drive", "traction", "D", "all position"

4. POSITION DETECTION:
   Steer: "steer", "front", "steering axle", "rib"
   Drive: "drive", "traction", "lug"
   Trailer: "trailer", "all position"

   Code Assignment:
   - Steer tires: 17-051 to 17-059
   - Drive tires: 17-061 to 17-069
   - Trailer tires: 17-071 to 17-079
   - All position: 17-081 to 17-089

==========================================
CODE ASSIGNMENT RULES
==========================================

TIRE POSITIONING:
- Steer/Front (Rib): 17-051 to 17-059
- Drive (Lug): 17-061 to 17-069
- Trailer: 17-071 to 17-079
- All Position: 17-081 to 17-089

SIZE-SPECIFIC CODES:
- 11R22.5 Drive: 17-061
- 11R22.5 Steer: 17-051
- 295/75R22.5 Drive: 17-062
- 295/75R22.5 Steer: 17-052

WHEELS AND RIMS:
- Steel wheels: 17-100 to 17-119
- Aluminum wheels: 17-120 to 17-139

==========================================
VALIDATION RULES
==========================================

CRITICAL CHECKS:
1. Tire size must be valid format
2. Position must match tread pattern (rib=steer, lug=drive)
3. Ply rating should align with duty level
4. Wheel size must match tire size if specified

CONSISTENCY CHECKS:
- Steer tires should have rib pattern
- Drive tires should have lug pattern
- Tire size must be extracted and noted
- Ply rating should be documented

COMMON ERROR PATTERNS:
- Rib tire mapped to drive code → FAIL
- Lug tire mapped to steer code → FAIL
- Missing size specification → FLAG FOR REVIEW
- Position/pattern mismatch → FLAG FOR REVIEW

==========================================
CONFIDENCE SCORING GUIDELINES
==========================================

HIGH CONFIDENCE (90-100%):
- Size clearly specified
- Position clearly indicated
- Tread pattern matches position
- Exact match in validated database

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (70-89%):
- Size specified but position unclear
- Pattern suggested but not explicit
- Similar tire in validated database

LOW CONFIDENCE (<70%):
- Size unclear or missing
- Position ambiguous
- Pattern not specified
→ Require web search

==========================================
EXAMPLES
==========================================

GOOD MAPPINGS:
✓ "11R22.5 Drive Tire 14 Ply" → 17-061
  Reason: Size + position (drive) + ply rating all clear

✓ "295/75R22.5 Steer Tire Rib" → 17-052
  Reason: Size + position (steer) + pattern (rib) match

✓ "11R22.5 All Position Tire" → 17-081
  Reason: Size + application (all position) clear

PROBLEMATIC CASES:
✗ "Truck Tire" → INSUFFICIENT INFO
  Reason: No size, position, or pattern specified

✗ "11R22.5 Tire" → REQUIRES WEB SEARCH
  Reason: Size specified but position/pattern missing

✗ "Steer Tire 14 Ply" → REQUIRES WEB SEARCH
  Reason: Position clear but size missing

==========================================
SPECIAL HANDLING
==========================================

1. RETREAD TIRES:
   - Map to same codes as new tires
   - Note "RETREAD" in description
   - Position and size still required

2. WINTER/SPECIALTY TIRES:
   - Map based on position (steer/drive/trailer)
   - Note specialty application in description
   - No separate codes for winter tires

3. DUAL APPLICATIONS:
   Example: "All Position Tire"
   → Map to all position code (17-081+)
   → Note can be used in multiple positions
