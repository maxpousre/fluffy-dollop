Information to Extract:
- Component type (pad/shoe/rotor/drum/caliper)
- Position (front/rear/drive axle/trailer axle/steer)
- Brake system type (air/hydraulic)
- Duty level (heavy/light/standard)
- Dimensions (diameter, width, thickness for rotors/drums)
- Application (vehicle types, makes, models, GVW)
- Manufacturer details
- Air brake specific: chamber type, stroke length
- Hydraulic specific: piston diameter, caliper type

Minimum Required Info for Mapping:
- Component type (pad/rotor/caliper/drum)
- Position (front/rear)
- Brake type (air/hydraulic) if not obvious from application

Flag for Human Review if:
- Conflicting information across sources
- Position unclear after research
- Custom or modified component
- Multiple applications with different positions
- Air vs hydraulic ambiguous
