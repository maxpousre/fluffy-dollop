DESCRIPTION: Lubrication System Components

==========================================
WEB SEARCH CONFIGURATION
==========================================
WEB_SEARCH_REQUIRED: True
WEB_SEARCH_CATEGORIES:
  - Filters with unclear application (engine vs transmission)
  - Specialty lubricants and fluids
  - Custom or multi-application filters

WEB_SEARCH_QUERY_TEMPLATE: "Is {Part Name} {Part Code} used for engine or transmission"

==========================================
PATTERN MATCHING RULES
==========================================

1. OIL FILTER DETECTION:
   Keywords: "oil filter", "engine filter", "lube filter"

   Application Keywords:
   - Engine: "engine", "motor", "crankcase"
   - Transmission: "transmission", "trans", "gearbox", "allison"
   - Hydraulic: "hydraulic", "hyd", "power steering"

   Filter Style:
   - Spin-on: "spin-on", "spin on", "cartridge style"
   - Cartridge: "cartridge", "element", "insert"

   Code Assignment:
   - Engine oil filter spin-on: 10-040
   - Engine oil filter cartridge: 10-041
   - Transmission filter: 10-050 to 10-059
   - Hydraulic filter: 10-060 to 10-069

2. FUEL FILTER DETECTION:
   Keywords: "fuel filter", "diesel filter", "gas filter"

   Primary/Secondary:
   - Primary: "primary", "first stage", "water separator"
   - Secondary: "secondary", "final", "polish"

   Code Range: 10-100 to 10-119

3. AIR FILTER DETECTION:
   Keywords: "air filter", "intake filter", "engine air"

   Code Range: 10-200 to 10-219

==========================================
CODE ASSIGNMENT RULES
==========================================

ENGINE LUBRICATION:
- Oil filters (spin-on): 10-040
- Oil filters (cartridge): 10-041
- Oil coolers: 10-045

TRANSMISSION LUBRICATION:
- Transmission filters: 10-050 to 10-059
- Transmission coolers: 10-055

HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS:
- Hydraulic filters: 10-060 to 10-069

==========================================
VALIDATION RULES
==========================================

CRITICAL CHECKS:
1. Filter type must match application (engine/transmission/hydraulic)
2. Spin-on vs cartridge designation must be correct
3. Fuel filters must not be mapped to oil filter codes

CONSISTENCY CHECKS:
- Engine filters should indicate "engine" in notes
- Transmission filters should reference transmission type if known
- Style (spin-on/cartridge) must align with code

COMMON ERROR PATTERNS:
- Transmission filter mapped to engine code → FAIL
- Hydraulic filter mapped to engine code → FAIL
- Missing application specification → FLAG FOR REVIEW

==========================================
CONFIDENCE SCORING GUIDELINES
==========================================

HIGH CONFIDENCE (90-100%):
- Clear application stated (engine/transmission/hydraulic)
- Filter style clearly indicated
- Exact match in validated database

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (70-89%):
- Application implied but not explicit
- Filter style assumed from part number
- Similar pattern in validated database

LOW CONFIDENCE (<70%):
- Application unclear
- Could be multiple applications
- No similar examples in database
→ Require web search

==========================================
EXAMPLES
==========================================

GOOD MAPPINGS:
✓ "Engine Oil Filter Spin-On" → 10-040
  Reason: Application (engine) + style (spin-on) both clear

✓ "Allison Transmission Filter" → 10-050
  Reason: Application (transmission) + manufacturer clear

✓ "Hydraulic Filter Cartridge" → 10-060
  Reason: Application (hydraulic) + style clear

PROBLEMATIC CASES:
✗ "Oil Filter" → REQUIRES WEB SEARCH
  Reason: Application unclear (engine? transmission? hydraulic?)

✗ "Filter Element" → INSUFFICIENT INFO
  Reason: Type and application both missing
